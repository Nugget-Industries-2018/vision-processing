Algorithm Description
#######################

This algorithm is used to connect to a livestream via IP adress and detect any and all 
shapes with their corresponding colors. After it does this it will overlay the corresponding aircraft.
First the code connects to the livestream via the cv2.VideoCapture command, once we have a live feed at the ready 
we define masks to detect for red, blue, and yellow. Once the mask is applied to the video capture variable, we 
find the contours and loop over them. Set conditional statements to determine if shape is a triangle or square/rectangle.
We then match the combination of color and shape to the designated aircraft. Lastly we overlay the data we've collected
and display it on the live feed.
